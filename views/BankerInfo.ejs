    <div class="container" style="width: 100rem">
      <p style="color: white; font-size: 1.25rem">
        It is a banker algorithm used to avoid deadlock and allocate resources
        safely to each process in the computer system. The 'S-State' examines
        all possible tests or activities before deciding whether the allocation
        should be allowed to each process. It also helps the operating system to
        successfully share the resources between all the processes. The banker's
        algorithm is named because it checks whether a person should be
        sanctioned a loan amount or not to help the bank system safely simulate
        allocation resources.

            <h1 class="sub-headings">Advantages</h1>
            <li>
              Each process should provide information to the operating system
              for upcoming resource requests, the number of resources, and how
              long the resources will be held.
            </li>
            <li>
              It helps the operating system manage and control process requests
              for each type of resource in the computer system.
            </li>
            <li>
              The algorithm has a Max resource attribute that represents
              indicates each process can hold the maximum number of resources in
              a system.
            </li>

            <h1 class="sub-headings">Disadvantages</h1>
            <li>
              It requires a fixed number of processes, and no additional
              processes can be started in the system while executing the
              process.
            </li>
            <li>
              The algorithm does no longer allows the processes to exchange its
              maximum needs while processing its tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each process has to know and state their maximum resource
              requirement in advance for the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              The number of resource requests can be granted in a finite time,
              but the time limit for allocating the resources is one year.
