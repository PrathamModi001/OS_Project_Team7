    <p style="color: white; font-size: 1.25rem">
      This is a game of memory! You will be shown four blocks and once you start
      the game one of them will blink and you will have to press that block
      after you press the correct block another block will blink and you will
      have to click all the previously blinked blocks in the correct order so
      you can forward to the next level. Else the game will restart.

    <h1 class="sub-headings2">Match The Arrow</h1>
    <p style="color: white; font-size: 1.25rem">
      This is a game of accuracy and alertness. On the screen there will be
      arrows shown. if the arrow is having red background color you have to
      press the arrow from your keyboard that points in the opposite direction
      and if the arrow is having blue background color, you have to press the
      arrow key from your keyboard that points in the same direction as shown on
      the screen
    </p>
    <h1 class="sub-headings2">RGB Guesser</h1>
    <p style="color: white; font-size: 1.25rem">
      This is a very simple game that tests your knowledge in color theory.
      There will be an RGB value displayed on the screen and nine blocks below
      that, you have to select the block with the same RGB value shown on the
      screen and if you do so all the blocks on the screen will turn into that
      color, and if you fail to detect the correct block that block will
      disappear, giving you more tries to find the correct block and this will
      happen until you find the correct block.
